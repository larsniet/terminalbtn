# Terminalbtn

This extension simply adds a terminal button to the status bar instead of having to use the shortcut, which is ctrl+` by default. This is useful for people who use the terminal a lot and don't like using the shortcut for it.

## Features

Toggle the terminal with a button on the status bar. The button is located on the bottom right of the status bar. This makes it easier to access the terminal without having to use a shortcut. A lot of other extensions provide this, but are bloated with other features or collect your data. This extension is lightweight and doesn't collect any data, we like to keep it simple :smirk:.

## Usage

* Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Terminalbtn: Toggle Terminal` to toggle the terminal.
* Click the button on the status bar to toggle the terminal.
